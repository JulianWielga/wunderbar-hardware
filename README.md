The WunderBar Schematics and Layout Repository
------------

Welcome to the **WunderBar Hardware Schematics and Layout** repository.
This repository contains the latest version of the *[WunderBar](https://relayr.io/wunderbar)* hardware design.
The *WunderBar* is manufactured by *[MikroElektronika](http://www.mikroe.com/wunderbar)*.   Manufacturing was sponsored by *[Conrad Electronics](http://www.conrad.de)*.

Here you will find everything you need to build your own version of the WunderBar. We encourage you to share, modify, extend and improve the existing design. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or need any help. We are eager to hear your feedback about the design, and suggestions as to how we might improve it.

### Datasheets:
In the *[/Datasheets](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/tree/master/Datasheets)* folder you will find the relevant data sheets for the micro controller units (MCUs), the sensors and the additional circuitry, separated by module type.

### Schematics:
The complete project for [*Altium Designer* <sup>TM</sup>](http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview) is located in the *[AltiumDesignerProject](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/tree/master/AltiumDesignerProject)* folder.

For a quick overview of the schematics for the Master Module and the 6 BLE modules, see the  *[WunderBar Schematics v1_3.pdf file](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/blob/master/WunderBar%20Schematics%20v1_3.pdf)*.

### Layout:
A PDF output of the PCB Layout can be found under *[Wunderbar Layout.pdf](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/blob/master/WunerBar%20Layout%20v1_3.pdf)*. For a detailed view of the different layers and connections see the *[Altium](http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview)* project.

### Bill of Materials:
The *[Bill of Materials v1_3](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/blob/master/Bill%20of%20Materials%20v1_3.xls)* sheet details the components' names, quantities, the suppliers' names and part numbers. See also the two files under *[/Manufacturing/BillOfMaterials](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/tree/master/Manufacturing/BillOfMaterials)* for a list view of the information in the Schematics file.

### Gerber Files:
The Gerber files output and the 'Pick and Place' configuration files are located inside the [*/Manufacturing*](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/tree/master/Manufacturing) folder.

### Acquiring the Files:
* To get the entire repository, download it as a **.zip** file from [here](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/archive/master.zip).

or

* If you have **git** installed simply access the folder where you want to download it and enter the following command:

	`git clone https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware.git`


We hope that you'd utilize the Wunderbar in your future projects. The realm of possibilities is as vast as your imagination!!!
