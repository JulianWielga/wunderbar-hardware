WunderBar Hardware
------------

Welcome to the **WunderBar Hardware Schematics and Layout**.
This repository contains the latest version of the *WunderBar* hardware design.

The *WunderBar* is actually being manufactured by *MikroElektronika* (http://www.mikroe.com/wunderbar/). However, if you want to make your own custom version, we encourage you to share, modify, extend and improve the actual design!! Therefore here is all you need to manufacture your own version:

### Datasheets:
In the *"/Datasheets"* folder you will find the relevant ICs datasheets of the MCUs, sensors and extra circuitery separated by module.
### Schematics:
The complete project for Altium Designer <sup>TM</sup>: http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview is located in the *"AltiumDesignerProject"* folder.

For a quick look into the schematics for the Master Module and the 6 BLE modules, check the file *"WunderBar Schematics v1_3.pdf"*.

### Layout:
A PDF output of the PCB Layout is in *"Wunderbat Layout.pdf"*. For a detailed view of the different layers and connections open the *Altium* project.

### Bill of Materials:
The *"Bill of Materials v1_3"* sheet details the components names, quantity, supplier name and part numbers. There are also two files inside *"/Manufacturing/BillOfMaterials"* wich relates the components to the actual designator code on the Schematics and Layout.

### Gerber Files:
The Gerber files output and Pick and Place configuration files are located inside the *"/Manufacturing"* folder.

#### To get all the files:
* Download the repository as a **.zip** file from [here](https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware/archive/master.zip).

or

* If you have **git** installed just go to folder where you want to download it and do:

	`git clone https://github.com/relayr/wunderbar-hardware.git`


We hope that you'd utilize the Wunderbar in your future projects. The realm of possibilities is as vast as your imagination!!!
